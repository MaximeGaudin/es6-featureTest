# ES6 Features - Today !

Since I have some time to poke around with one of the many things I don't know yet, I decided to try some of the new features of the ECMA Script 6 specifications.

You can find all my snippet in the `src/` directory.

To compile them in a _today compatible_ way, simple type :

	npm install
	gulp

Every ES5 compatible files are produced in the `dist/` folder.

Enjoy :)
